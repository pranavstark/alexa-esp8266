Control your home appliances using Alexa

This code works on ESP8266 Microcontroller. It uses fauxmoesp, a library for ESP8266/ESP32-based devices that emulates 
Philips Hue lights and thus allows you to control them using this protocol, in particular from Alexa-powered devices like the
Amazon Echo or the Dot
